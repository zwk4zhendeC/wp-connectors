## [Unreleased]

## [0.10.0] - 2026-03-12

### Added
- Add HTTP sink connector with configurable `endpoint`, `method`, `headers`, basic auth, batching, retries, and optional gzip compression
- Add HTTP sink examples and a local test server under `examples/http/`
- Add Postgres sink support with dedicated `postgres` connector module, factory, config parser, and sink implementation

### Changed
- Upgrade core WP dependencies to 0.8 series (`wp-connector-api`, `wp-parse-api`, `wp-error`, `wp-specs`, `wp-conf-base`, `wp-log`)
- Upgrade Orion dependencies (`orion-error` to 0.6, `orion_conf` to 0.5)
- Bump project version to `0.10.0`
- Clarify Elasticsearch connector support in 0.10 (`elasticsearch` feature, included in default features)
- Adopt version channel policy: odd `minor` for integration, even `minor` for stable, `patch` for fixes only
- Enable the `http` connector in the default feature set
- Change ClickHouse sink configuration from `host` to `endpoint` and support explicit HTTP(S) endpoints
- Enable the `postgres` connector in the default and `full` feature sets
- Add Postgres connection support in shared database dependencies (`sqlx-postgres` via SeaORM)

### Fixed
- Fix Kafka/MySQL build breaks after dependency upgrades
- Align `RawData` import with new public path (`wp_model_core::raw::RawData`)
- Align error handling with `orion-error` 0.6 (`ErrorOweBase`, `from_validation()`, `UvsReason::data_error()`)
- Refine HTTP sink JSON payload handling and related examples
- Correct a Postgres sink test case
- Harden Doris Stream Load handling for `Publish Timeout`, `Label Already Exists`, filtered-row partial success, and non-retryable `Fail` responses
- Generate deterministic Doris load labels from batch payloads so caller-level retries can preserve Stream Load idempotency
- Make Doris sink shutdown terminal and validate retry configuration values more strictly
- Add Doris unit and `httpmock` coverage for retry, conflict, and partial-failure paths
